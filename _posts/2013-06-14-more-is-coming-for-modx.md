## More is coming for MODX

Over the past few months some interesting development have been happening in the MODX community. One of those changes is the whole transition between the [SiphonLabs][siphon] team and the [MODX][modx] team. Now that the skies has cleared of all the cloud I am happy with the progress of both companies.

> SiphonLabs will be at this year's [Wordcamp][wordcamp] go check them out.

Other changes that I am really happy about is the announcement of [modmore][]
