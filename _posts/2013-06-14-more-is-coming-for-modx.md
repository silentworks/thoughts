## More is coming for MODX

Over the past few months some interesting development have been happening in the MODX community. One of those changes is the whole transition between the [SiphonLabs][siphon] team and the [MODX][modx] team. Now that the skies have cleared of all the cloud I am happy with the progress of both companies.

> [SiphonLabs][siphon] will be at this year's [Wordcamp][wordcamp] go check them out.

Other changes that I am really happy about is the announcement of [modmore][]. This is a new company by community member [Mark Hamstra][mark] selling professionally developed [MODX][modx] addons (extras as some call them). This has been something the MODX community have been lacking in the past and to see a viable commercial marketplace being opened is a great thing.

It would be great to see the community get behind this, [Mark Hamstra][mark] has spent countless hours helping members of the community, working for [MODX][modx] as a employee in the past and continue to support the community and the platform to this very day. He currently donates some of his time in making [MODX][modx] better for the community as a whole.

When I said [__Build Awesome__][build] this is the kind of awesomeness I like seeing, [Mark Hamstra][mark] and those working with him have taken awesomeness to its fullness and your support is required to make this a success for [Mark][mark] and [MODX][modx] as a whole.

Go get more out of your [MODX][modx] and join [modmore][]
