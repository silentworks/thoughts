Recently folks have been asking about what middlewares are available for Slim 3. Although Slim 3 is still in RC stage, there have been a number of developers who have decided to create middlewares already. Here I am going to list the ones I think are beneficial to the community and to keep an eye on.

Before I continue, do note that most PSR7 middlewares should work with Slim 3, we have intentionally not included an Interface for PSR7 middlewares in Slim 3 to keep the PHP eco-system healthy and promote using PSR7 methods in middlewares and not use Slim specific methods where possible.
