I have been trying to lean new libraries over the past few weeks, more recently I started looking into Doctrine ORM again. I have used it in the past when it was Doctrine 1 and also used Doctrine 2 for a small amount of time, but I now wanted to explore more into the library and get a better understanding of using it.
